# alfred-router-web-interface
An [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow which finds your default gateway's IP and opens it in your default browser.

#### Usage

Begin typing "router", then press enter once to find your gateway's IP and then press enter once again to open this IP in your default browser, which is basically opening your router's web interface.

Note: This will most probably work fine with SOHO routers only.

#### Licence

This workflow is released under the MIT License.
